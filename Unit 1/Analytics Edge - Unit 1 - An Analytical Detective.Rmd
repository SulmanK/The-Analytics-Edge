## Background Information on the Dataset

Crime is an international concern, but it is documented and handled in very different ways in different countries. In the United States, violent crimes and property crimes are recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Additionally, each city documents crime, and some cities release data regarding crime rates. The city of Chicago, Illinois releases crime data from 2001 onward [online](www.bit.ly/1EqAdIp).

Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States, with a population of over 2.7 million people. The city of Chicago is shown in the map below, with the state of Illinois highlighted in red.

There are two main types of crimes: violent crimes, and property crimes. In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property crime, called "motor vehicle theft" (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago. 

Please download the file [mvtWeek1.csv](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/96f9b8f751467da3a4b8a5be33e32905/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+3T2018+type@asset+block/mvtWeek1.csv). for this problem (do not open this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field). Here is a list of descriptions of the variables:

* **ID**: a unique identifier for each observation

* **Date**: the date the crime occurred

* **LocationDescription**: the location where the crime occurred

* **Arrest**: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made)
Domestic: whether or not the crime was a domestic crime, meaning that it was committed against a family member (TRUE if it was domestic, and FALSE if it was not domestic)
Beat: the area, or "beat" in which the crime occurred. This is the smallest regional division defined by the Chicago police department.
District: the police district in which the crime occured. Each district is composed of many beats, and are defined by the Chicago Police Department.

* **CommunityArea**: the community area in which the crime occurred. Since the 1920s, Chicago has been divided into what are called "community areas", of which there are now 77. The community areas were devised in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.

* **Year**: the year in which the crime occurred.

* **Latitude**: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.

* **Longitude**: the longitude of the location at which the crime occurred.

## R Exercises

Read the dataset [mvtWeek1.csv](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/96f9b8f751467da3a4b8a5be33e32905/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+3T2018+type@asset+block/mvtWeek1.csv). into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frame "mvt". Remember to navigate to the directory on your computer containing the file mvtWeek1.csv first. It may take a few minutes to read in the data, since it is pretty large. Then, use the str and summary functions to answer the following questions.

``` {r load mvtWeek1.csv}
mvt = read.csv("mvtWeek1.csv")
```

### How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?
```{r How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset}
str(mvt)
```

**Explanation**: If you type str(mvt) in the R console, the first row of output says that this is a data frame with 191,641 observations.

### How many variables are in this dataset?

```{r How many variables are in this dataset}
str(mvt)
```

**Explanation**: If you type str(mvt) in the R console, the first row of output says that this is a data frame with 11 variables.



### Using the "max" function, what is the maximum value of the variable "ID"?
```{r Using the max function}
max(mvt$ID)
```

**Explanation**: You can compute the maximum value of the ID variable with max(mvt$ID).

### What is the minimum value of the variable "Beat"?
```{r What is the minimum value of the variable Beat}
summary(mvt) 

min(mvt$Beat)
```

**Explanation**: If you type summary(mvt) in your R console, you can see the summary statistics for each variable. This shows that the minimum value of Beat is 111. Alternatively, you could use the min function by typing min(mvt$Beat).

### How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?
```{r How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)}
summary(mvt) 
```

**Explanation**: If you type summary(mvt) in your R console, you can see the summary statistics for each variable. This shows that 15,536 observations fall under the category TRUE for the variable Arrest.

### How many observations have a LocationDescription value of ALLEY?

```{r How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable}
summary(mvt) 

table(mvt$LocationDescription)
```

**Explanation**: If you type summary(mvt) in your R console, you can see the summary statistics for each variable. This shows that 2,308 observations fall under the category ALLEY for the variable LocationDescription. You can also read this from table(mvt$LocationDescription).

### In what format are the entries in the variable Date?

```{r In what format are the entries in the variable Date}
mvt$Date[1] 
```

**Explanation**: If you type mvt$Date[1] in your R console, you can see that the first entry is 12/31/12 23:15. This must be in the format Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute.

Now, let's convert these characters into a Date object in R. In your R console, type
``` {r dateconvert}
DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
```

This converts the variable "Date" into a Date object in R. Take a look at the variable DateConvert using the summary function.

### What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset?

```{r What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset}
summary(DateConvert)
```

**Explanation**: If you type summary(DateConvert), you can see that the median date is 2006-05-21.

Now, let's extract the month and the day of the week, and add these variables to our data frame mvt. We can do this with two simple functions. Type the following commands in R:

``` {r MonthWeek}
mvt$Month = months(DateConvert)

mvt$Weekday = weekdays(DateConvert)
```

This creates two new variables in our data frame, Month and Weekday, and sets them equal to the month and weekday values that we can extract from the Date object. Lastly, replace the old Date variable with DateConvert by typing:

``` {r NewDate}
mvt$Date = DateConvert
```

### In which month did the fewest motor vehicle thefts occur?

```{r FewestVehicleThefts}
table(mvt$Month) 
```

**Explanation**: If you type table(mvt$Month), you can see that the month with the smallest number of observations is February.

### On which weekday did the most motor vehicle thefts occur?

```{r weekday did the most motor vehicle thefts occur}
table(mvt$Weekday)
```

**Explanation**: If you type table(mvt$Weekday), you can see that the weekday with the largest number of observations is Friday.

### Which month has the largest number of motor vehicle thefts for which an arrest was made?

```{r weekday largetheftsarrest}
table(mvt$Arrest,mvt$Month)
```

**Explanation**: If you type table(mvt\$Arrest,mvt$Month), you can see that the largest number of observations with Arrest=TRUE occurs in the month of January.

### Visualizing Crime Trends
First, let's make a histogram of the variable Date. We'll add an extra argument, to specify the number of bars we want in our histogram. In your R console, type

``` {r Histogram100breaks}
hist(mvt$Date, breaks=100)
```

#### In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2002 - 2012?

While there is not a clear trend, it looks like crime generally decreases.

#### In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2005 - 2008?

In this time period, there is a clear downward trend in crime.

#### In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2009 - 2011?

In this time period, there is a clear upward trend in crime.

Now, lets see how arrests have changed over time by creating a boxplot

``` {r Boxplotarrests}
boxplot(mvt$Date ~ mvt$Arrest)
```

#### Does it look like there were more crimes for which arrests were made in the first half of the time period or the second half of the time period? 

If you look at the boxplot, the one for Arrest=TRUE is definitely skewed towards the bottom of the plot, meaning that there were more crimes for which arrests were made in the first half of the time period

#### For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2001 was an arrest made?

``` {r proportion of motor vehicle thefts}
table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year)
```

**Explanation**: If you create a table using the command table(mvt\$Arrest, mvt$Year), the column for 2001 has 2152 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 18517 observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts in 2001 for which an arrest was made is thus 2152/(2152+18517) = 0.1041173.

#### For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2007 was an arrest made?

``` {r proportion of motor vehicle thefts 2007}
table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year)
```

**Explanation**: If you create a table using the command table(mvt\$Arrest, mvt$Year), the column for 2007 has 1212 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 13068 observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts in 2007 for which an arrest was made is thus 1212/(1212+13068) = 0.08487395.

#### For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2012 was an arrest made?

``` {r proportion of motor vehicle thefts 2012}
table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year)
```

**Explanation**: If you create a table using the command table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year), the column for 2012 has 550 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 13542 observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts in 2012 for which an arrest was made is thus 550/(550+13542) = 0.03902924.

Since there may still be open investigations for recent crimes, this could explain the trend we are seeing in the data. There could also be other factors at play, and this trend should be investigated further. However, since we don't know when the arrests were actually made, our detective work in this area has reached a dead end.


### Popular Locations of Interest

We want to find the top five locations where motor vehicle thefts occur. If you create a table of the LocationDescription variable, it is unfortunately very hard to read since there are 78 different locations in the data set. By using the sort function, we can view this same table, but sorted by the number of observations in each category. In your R console, type:
``` {r PopulatLocations}
sort(table(mvt$LocationDescription))
```


#### Which locations are the top five locations for motor vehicle thefts, excluding the "Other" category?

These are Street, Parking Lot/Garage (Non. Resid.), Alley, Gas Station, and Driveway - Residential.

#### How many observations are in Top5?

Create a subset of the Top5 locations.

``` {r SubSetTop5}
Top5 = subset(mvt, LocationDescription=="STREET" | LocationDescription=="PARKING LOT/GARAGE(NON.RESID.)" | LocationDescription=="ALLEY" | LocationDescription=="GAS STATION" | LocationDescription=="DRIVEWAY - RESIDENTIAL")
```

#### One of the locations has a much higher arrest rate than the other locations. Which is it?

To make our tables a bit nicer to read, we can refresh this factor variable. In your R console, type:

``` {r easiertoread}
Top5$LocationDescription = factor(Top5$LocationDescription)

m = table(Top5$LocationDescription, Top5$Arrest)

prop.table(m,1)
```

Gas Station has by far the highest percentage of arrests, with over 20% of motor vehicle thefts resulting in an arrest.

#### On which day of the week do the most motor vehicle thefts at gas stations happen?

``` {r popularvehiclethefts}

m = table(Top5$LocationDescription, Top5$Weekday)

prop.table(m,1)
```

Saturday is the day where most motor vehicle thefts at gas stations occur.

#### On which day of the week do the fewest motor vehicle thefts in residential driveways happen?

``` {r lowvehicletheftsaturday}

m = table(Top5$LocationDescription, Top5$Weekday)

prop.table(m,1)
```

Saturday is the day where most motor vehicle thefts at residential driveways occur.
