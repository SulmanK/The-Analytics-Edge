## The Framingham Heart Study

### Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR)

* President of the United States, 1933 - 1945
    + Longest-serving president
    + Led country through Great Depression
    + Commander in Chief of US military in World War II

* Died while president, April 12, 1945

### FDR's Blood Pressure

* Before presidency, blood pressure of 140/100
    + Healthy blood pressure is less than 120/80
    + Today, this is already considered high blood pressure

* One year before death, 210/120
    + Today, this is called Hypertensive Crisis, and emergency care is needed
    + FDR's personal physician: 
    "A moderate degree of arteriosclerosis, although no more than normal for a man of his age"
* Two months before death: 260/150
* Day of death: 300/190

### Early Misconceptions
* High blood pressure dubbed *essential hypertension*
    + Considered important to force blood through arteries
    + Considered harmful to lower blood pressure
* Today, presidential blood pressure numbers like FDR's would send the country's leading doctors racing down hallways ... whisking the nation's leader into cardiac care unit of Bethesda Naval Hospital."
" - Daniel Levy, Framingham Heart Study Director

### How Did We Learn?
* In late 1940s, U.S. Government set out to better understand cardiovascular disease (CVD)
* Plan: track large cohort of initially health patients over time
* City of Framingham, MA selected as site for study
    + Appropriate size
    + Stable population
    + Cooperative doctors and residents
* 1948: beginning of Framingham Heart Study

### The Framingham Heart Study
* 5,209 patients aged 30-59 enrolled
* Patients given questionnaire and exams every 2 years
    + Physical characteristics
    + Behavioral characteristics
    + Test results
* Exams and questions expanded over time
* We will build models using the Framingham data to predict and prevent heart disease

### Analytics to Prevent Heart Disease

### Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

* We will predict 10-year risk of CHD
    + Subject of important 1998 paper, introducing the Framingham Risk Score

* CHD is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart

* Heart disease has been leading the cause of death worldwide since 1921
      + 7.3 million people died from CHD in 2008
      + Since 1950, age-adjusted death rates have declined 60%
      
### Risk Factors

* *Risk factors* are variables that increase the chances of a disease

* Term coined by William Kannel and Roy Dawber from the Framing Ham Heart Study

* Key to successful prediction of CHD: identifying important risk factors

### Hypothesized CHD Risk Factors

* We will investigate risk factors collected in the first data collection for the study
    * Anonymized version of original data

* Demographic risk factors
      + *male*: sex of patient
      + *age*: age in years at first examination
      + *education*: Some high school (1), high school/GED (2), some college/vocation school (3), college(4)
      
### An Analytical Approach

* Randomly split patients into training and testing sets

* Use logistic regression on training set to predict whether or not a patient experienced CHD within 10 years of first examination

* Evaluate predictive power on test set

### Model Strength

* Model rarely predicts 10-year CHD risk above 50%
    + Accuracy very near a baseline of always predicting no CHD

* Model can differentiate low-risk from high-risk patients (AUC = 0.74)

* Some significant variable suggest interventions
    + Smoking
    + Cholesterol
    + Systolic blood pressure
    + Glucose
    
### Risk Model Validation

* So far, we have used *internal validation*
    + Train with some patients, test with others

* Weakness: unclear if model generalizes to other populations

* Framingham color white, middle class

* Important to test on other populations

### Framingham Risk Model Validation
* Framingham Risk Model tested on diverse cohorts

<center>

![](frm.png)

</center>

* Cohort studies collecting same risk factors
* Validation Plan
      + Predict CHD risk for each patient using FHS model
      + Compare to actual outcomes for each docile
      

### Drugs to Lower Blood Pressure

* In FDR's time, hypertension drugs too toxic for practical use
* In 1950s, the diuretic chlorothiazied was developed
* Framingham Heart Study gave Ed Freis the evidence needed to argue for testing effects of BP drugs
* Veterans Administration (VA) Trial: randomized, double blind clinical trial
* Found decreased risk of CHD
* Now, >$1B market for diuretics worldwide

### Drugs to Lower Cholesterol
* Despite Framingham results, early cholesterol drugs too toxic for practical use
* In 1970s, first statins were developed
* Study of 4,444 patients with CHD: status cause 37% risk reduction of second heart attack
* Study of 6,595 men with high cholesterol: statins cause 32% risk reduction of CVD deaths
* Now, > $20B market for statins worldwide

### Research Directions and Challenges
* Second generation enrolled in 1971, third in 2002
    + Enables study of family history as a risk factor

* More diverse cohorts begun in 1994 and 2003

* Social network analysis of participants

* Genome-wide association study linking studying genetics as risk factors

* Many challenges related to funding
    + Funding cuts in 1969 nearly closed study
    + 2013 sequester threatening to close study
    
### Clinical Decision Rules
* Paved the way for *clinical decision rules*
* Predict clinical outcomes with data
      + Patient and disease characteristics
      + Test results
* More than 75,000 published across medicine
* Rate increasing

## Framingham Heart Study in R

### Load in the dataset
```{r load dataset}
# Read in the dataset
framingham = read.csv("framingham.csv")
```

# Split up the data using subset
train = subset(framingham, split==TRUE)
test = subset(framingham, split==FALSE)
```

### Logistic Regression

```
### Make Predictions
