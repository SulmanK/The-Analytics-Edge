## Making Hosptials Run Smoothly

### Operating Room Schedules

* Hospitals have a limited number of ORs.

* Operating room managers must determine a weekly schedule assigning ORs to different departments in the hospitals.

### Difficulties

* Creating an acceptable schedule is a highly political process within the hospital

* Surgeons are frequently paid on a fee-for-service basis, so changing allocated OR hours directly affects their income

* The operating room manager's proposed schedule must strike a delicate balance between all the surgical departments in the hospital

### Logistical Issues

* Operating rooms are staffed in 8 hour blocks.

* Each department sets their own target number of allocation hours, which may not be integer.

* Departments may have daily and weekly requirements:
    + EX) Gynecology needs at least 1 OR per day
    + EX) Ophthalmology needs at least 2 ORs per week
    + EX) The oral surgeon is only present on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 
### Case study: Mount Sinai Hospital

* Has 10 ORs which are staffed Monday - Friday
    + 10 ORs x 5 days x 8 hours/day = 400 hours to assign

* Must divide these 400 hours between 5 departments:

### Problem Data

* Number of surgery teams from each department available each day:

* Maximum number of ORs required by each department each day:

### Additional Problem Data

* Weekly requirement on number of ORs each department requires:

### The Traditional Way

* Before the integer optimization method was implemented at Mount Sinai in 1999, the OR manager used graph paper and a large eraser to try to assign the OR blocks

* Any changes were incorporated by trial and error

* Draft schedule was circulated to all surgical groups

* Incorporating feedback from one department usually meant altering another group's schedule, leading to many iterations of this process

### Optimization Problem

* Decisions
    + How many ORs to assign each department on each day.
    + Integer decision variables \(x_{jk}\) represent the number of operating rooms department \(j\) is allocated on day \(k\).
    
### Objective

* Maximize % of target allocation hours that each department is actually allocated.

* If target allocation hours are \(t_J\) for department \(j\), then we want to maximize the sum of \((8 * x_{jk}) \div t_j\) over all departments and days of the week.
    + Ex) If otolaryngology has a target of 37.3 hours per week and we allocate them 4 ORs then their % of target allocation hours = \((8 * 4) \div 37.3 = 85.8\%\)

### Constraints

* At most 10 ORs are assigned every day

* The number of ORs allocated to a department on a given day cannot exceed the number of surgery teams that department has available that day

* Meet department daily minimums and maximums

* Meet department daily weekly minimums and maximums


### Constraints

* \(x_{OP,M} + x_{GY,M} + x_{OS,M} + x_{OT,M} + x_{GY,M} \leq 10\)

* \(0 \leq x_{GY,F} \leq 3\)
* \(0 \leq x_{OS,W} \leq 0\)

* \(0 \leq x_{GS,T} \leq 8\)

* \(3 \leq x_{OP,M} + x_{OP,T} + x_{OP,W} + x_{OP,F} \leq 6\)
