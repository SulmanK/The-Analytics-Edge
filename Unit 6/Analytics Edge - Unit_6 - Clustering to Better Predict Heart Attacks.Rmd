## Predictive Diagnosis

### Heart Attacks

* Heart attack is a common complication of coronary heart disease resulting from the interruption of blood supply to part of the heart

* 2012 report from the American Heart Association estimates **about 715,000** Americans have a heart attack every year
    + **Every 20 seconds**, a person has a heart attack in the US
    + Nearly **half** occur without prior warning signs
    + **250,000** Americans die of Sudden Cardiac Death yearly
    
* Well - known symptoms
    + Chest pain, shortness of breath, upper body pain, nausea

* Nature of heart attacks make it hard to predict, prevent and even diagnose
    + **25%** of heart attacks are silent
    + **47%** of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside hospitals, suggesting many do not act on early warning signs
    + **27%** of respondents to a 2005 survey recognized the symptoms and called 911 for help

### Analytics Help Monitoring

* Understanding the clinical characteristics of patients in whom heart attack was missed is key

* Need for an increased understanding of patterns in a patient's diagnostic history that link to a heart attack

* Predicting whether a patient is at risk of a heart attack helps monitoring and calls for action

* Analytics help **understand patterns** of heart attacks and provides good predictions


### Claims Data

* Claims data offers an expansive view of a patient's health history
    + Demographics, medical history and medications
    + Offers insights regarding a patient's risk
    + May reveal **indicative signals and patterns**

* We will use health insurance claims filed for about 7,000 members from January 200 - November 2007


* Concentrated on members with the following attributes
    + At least 5 claims with coronary artery disease diagnosis
    + At least 5 claims with hypertension diagnostic codes
    + At least 100 total medical claims
    + At least 5 pharmacy claims
    + Data from at least 5 years

* Yields patients with a high risk of heart attack and a reasonably rich history and continuous coverage

### Data Aggregation

* The resulting dataset includes about **20 million health insurance entries** including individual medical and pharmaceutical records

* Diagnosis, procedure, and drug codes in the dataset comprise tens of thousands of attributes

* Codes were aggregated into groups
    + 218 diagnosis groups, 180 procedure groups, 538 drug groups
    + 46 diagnosis groups were considered by clinicians as possible risk factors for heart attacks
    
### Diagnostic History

* We then compress medical records to obtain a chronological representation of a patient's diagnostic profile
    + Cost and number of medical claims and hospital visits by diagnosis

* Observations split into 21 periods, each 90 days in length
    + Examined 9 months of diagnostic history leading up to heart attacks/no heart attack event
    + Align data to make observations date-independent while preserving the order of events
        - 3 months ~ 0 - 3 months before heart attack
        - 6 months ~ 3 - 6 months before heart attack
        - 9 months ~ 6 - 9 months before heart attack

### Target Variable

* Target prediction is the first occurrence of a heart attack
    + Diagnosis on medical claim
    + Visit to emergency room followed by hospitalization
    + Binary Yes/No

### Dataset Compilation

### Cost Bucket Partitioning

* Cost is a good summary of a person's overall health

* Divide population into similar smaller groups
    + Low risk, average risk, high risk

<center>

![](bucket.png)

</center>

* Build models for each group

### Predicting Heart Attacks (Random Forest)

* Predicting whether a patient has a heart attack for each of the cost buckets using the random forest algorithm

### Incorporating Clustering

* Patients in each bucket may have different characteristics

### Clustering Cost Buckets

* Two clustering algorithms were used for the analysis as an alternative to hierarchical clustering
    + Spectral Clustering
    + *k-means* clustering

### *k* - Means Clustering

</center>

### Practical Considerations

* The number of *k* can be selected from previous knowledge or experimenting

* Can strategically select initial partition of points into clusters if you have some knowledge of the data

* Can run algorithm several times with different random starting points

### Random Forest with Clustering

### Predicting Heart Attacks

* Perform clustering on each bucket using *k* = 10 clusters

* Average prediction rate for each cost bucket

### Impact of Clustering

* Clustering members with each cost bucket yielded better predictions of heart attacks within clusters

* Grouping patients in clusters exhibit temporal diagnostic patterns within 9 months of a heart attack

* These patterns can be incorporated in the diagnostic rules for heart attacks

* Greater research interns in using analytics for early heart failure detection through pattern recognition
