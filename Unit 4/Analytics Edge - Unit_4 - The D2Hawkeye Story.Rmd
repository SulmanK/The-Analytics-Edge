## The D2Hawkeye Story

### D2Hawkeye

* Founded by Chris Kryder, MD, MBA in 2001

* Combine expert knowledge and databases with analytics to improve quality and cost management in healthcare

* Located in Massachusetts USA, grew very fast and was sold to Verisk Analytics in 2009

### Healthcare Case Management

* D2Hawkeye tries to improve healthcare case management
    + Identify high-risk patients
    + Work with patients to manage treatment and associated costs
    + Arrange specialist care

* Medical costs often relate to severity of health problems, and are an issue for both patient and provider

* Goal: improve the quality of cost predictions

### Impact

* Many different types of clients
    + Third party administrators of medical claims
    + Case management companies
    + Benefit consultants
    + Health plans

* **Millions of people** analyzed monthly through analytic platform in 2009

* **Thousands of employers** processed monthly

### Pre-Analytics Approach
* Human judgement - MDs manually analyzed patient histories and developed

* Limited data sets

* Costly and inefficient

* Can we used analytics instead?

### Data Sources

* Healthcare industry is data-rich, but data may be hard to access
    + Unstructured - doctor's notes
    + Unavailable - hard to get due to differences in technology
    + Inaccessible - strong privacy laws around healthcare data sharing

* What is available?

* Claims data
    + Requests for reimbursement submitted to insurance companies or state-provided insurance from doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies.
    
* Eligibility information
* Demographic information

### Claims Data

* Rich, structured data source
* Very high dimension
* Doesn't capture all aspects of a persons treatment or health - many things must be inferred
* Unlike electronic medical records, we do not know the results of a test, only that a test was administered

### D2Hawkeye's Claims Data
* Available: claims data for **2.4 million people** over a span of **3 years**

* Include only people with data for at least 10 months in both periods - **400,000 people**

### Variables / Cost Profiles

* Variables
    + Chronic condition cost indicators
    + Gender and age

### Medical Intepretation of Buckets

### Error Measures
* Typically we use R^2^ or accuracy, but others can be used

* In case of D2Hawkeye, failing to classify a **high-cost patient** is worse than failing to classify a **low-cost patient** correctly

* Use a "penalty error" to capture this asymmetry

### Penalty Error
* Key idea: use asymmetric penalties
* Define a "penalty matrix" as the cost of being wrong

<center>

![](pe.png)

</center>

### Baseline
* Baseline is to simply predict that the cost in the next "period" will be the cost in the current period

* Accuracy of 75%
* Penalty Error of 0.56

### Multi-class Classification

* We use predicting a bucket number

</center>

### Most Important Factors

* First splits are related to cost

<center>

![](b2.png)

</center>

### Secondary Factors
* Risk factors
* Chronic Illness
* **"Q146"**
    + Asthma + depression
* **"Q1"**
    + Risk factor indicating hylan injection
    + Possible knee replacement or arthroscopy

### Example Groups for Bucket 5
* Under 35 years old, between $3300 and $3900 in claims, C.A.D., but no office visits in last year.

* Claims between $3900 and $43,000 with at least $8000 paid in last 12 months, $4300 in pharmacy claims, acute cost profile and cancer diagnosis

* More than $58,000 in claims, at least $55,000 paid in last 12 months, and not an acute profile

### Insights

* **Substantial improvement** over the baseline
* **Double accuracy** over baseline in some cases
* Smaller accuracy improvement on **bucket 5**, but **much lower penalty**

### Analytics Provide an Edge
* Substantial improvement in D2Hawkeye's ability to identify patients who need more attention

* Because the model was interpret able, physicians were able to improve the model by identifying new variables and refining existing variables

* Analytics gave D2Hawkeye an edge over competition using "last century" methods

## The D2Hawkeye Story in R

### Read in the data
```{r readdata}
# Read in the data
Claims = read.csv("ClaimsData.csv")
# Output structure
str(Claims)
```

### Split the data
```{r analb}
# Percentage of patients in each cost bucket
table(Claims$bucket2009)/nrow(Claims)

# Split the data
library(caTools)

set.seed(88)

spl = sample.split(Claims$bucket2009, SplitRatio = 0.6)

ClaimsTrain = subset(Claims, spl==TRUE)

ClaimsTest = subset(Claims, spl==FALSE)
```


### Baseline Method
```{r baseline}
# Baseline method
table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008)

(110138 + 10721 + 2774 + 1539 + 104)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
```
### Create Penalty Matrix
```{r penmatrix}
# Penalty Matrix
PenaltyMatrix = matrix(c(0,1,2,3,4,2,0,1,2,3,4,2,0,1,2,6,4,2,0,1,8,6,4,2,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)

PenaltyMatrix

# Penalty Error of Baseline Method
as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008))*PenaltyMatrix

sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008))*PenaltyMatrix)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
```


### CART Model
```{r cart}
# Load necessary libraries
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

# CART model
ClaimsTree = rpart(bucket2009 ~ age + alzheimers + arthritis + cancer + copd + depression + diabetes + heart.failure + ihd + kidney + osteoporosis + stroke + bucket2008 + reimbursement2008, data=ClaimsTrain, method="class", cp=0.00005)
# Plot CART
prp(ClaimsTree)


# Make predictions
PredictTest = predict(ClaimsTree, newdata = ClaimsTest, type = "class")

table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest)

(114141 + 16102 + 118 + 201 + 0)/nrow(ClaimsTest)

# Penalty Error
as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest))*PenaltyMatrix

sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest))*PenaltyMatrix)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
```

### CART model with loss matrix
```{r newcartmodel}
# New CART model with loss matrix
ClaimsTree = rpart(bucket2009 ~ age + alzheimers + arthritis + cancer + copd + depression + diabetes + heart.failure + ihd + kidney + osteoporosis + stroke + bucket2008 + reimbursement2008, data=ClaimsTrain, method="class", cp=0.00005, parms=list(loss=PenaltyMatrix))

# Redo predictions and penalty error
PredictTest = predict(ClaimsTree, newdata = ClaimsTest, type = "class")

table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest)

(94310 + 18942 + 4692 + 636 + 2)/nrow(ClaimsTest)

sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest))*PenaltyMatrix)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
```
