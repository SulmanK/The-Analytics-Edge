## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

### Great Power, Great Responsibility


* There are many ways to visualize the same data.

* You have just seen how to make quite attractive visualization with ggplot2, which has good default settings, but judgement is still required, e.g. do I vary the size, or do I vary the color

* Excel, etc. can also be used to make perfectly acceptable visualizations - or terrible ones.

### Whats the difference?

* $\color{green}{\text{Good visualizations...}}$

**Clearly and accurately convey the key messages in the data**

* $\color{red}{\text{Bad visualizations...}}$

**Obfuscate the data (either through ignorance, or malice!)**

### What does this mean?

* Visualizations can be used by an analyst for their own consumption, to gain insights

* Visualizations can also be used to provide information to a decision maker, and/or to convince someone

* Bad visualizations hide patterns that could give insight, or mislead decision makers

### Bad Visualizations

### Bad Visualization?

<center>

![](bc3.png)

</center>

* Not all points can be labeled, so data is lost

* Colors are meaningless are close enough to be confusing, but are still needed to make it readable

* 3D adds nothing, visible volume is larger than true share

### Better Visualization

<center>

![](bv4.png)

</center>

* All data is visible

* Don't lose small regions

* Can easily compare relative sizes

* Something to consider is that, for some people and applications, being not as "visually exciting" is a negative

### On a World Map?

* Possible with this data, but still a bit tedious to create we need to determine which countries lie in which region

* Shading all countries in a region the same color is misleading - countries in, e.g. Latin America, will send students at different rates

* We have access to per country data - we will plot it on a world map and see if it is effective.

### Bad Scales

* "Caucasian" bar is truncated

* Every bar has its own scale - compare "Native American" to "African American"

* Only thing useful is the numbers

* Minor: mixed precision, unclear rounding applied

### Two Rights Make A Wrong

<center>

![](tr.png)

</center>

* Different units suggest(non-existent) crossover in 1995

* Transformation shows true moments of change

### Family Matters

<center>

</center>

* If we are interested in shares within a year, its good

* If we want to see rates of change, it is pretty much unusable!

### Bar Charts
```{r barcharts}
# Load ggplot library
library(ggplot2)
# Load our data, which lives in intl.csv
intl = read.csv("intl.csv")
str(intl)
# We want to make a bar plot with region on the X axis
# and Percentage on the y-axis.
ggplot(intl, aes(x=Region, y=PercentOfIntl)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label=PercentOfIntl))
# Make Region an ordered factor
# We can do this with the re-order command and transform command. 
intl = transform(intl, Region = reorder(Region, -PercentOfIntl))
# Look at the structure
str(intl)
# Make the percentages out of 100 instead of fractions
intl$PercentOfIntl = intl$PercentOfIntl * 100
# Make the plot
ggplot(intl, aes(x=Region, y=PercentOfIntl)) +
geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="dark blue") +
geom_text(aes(label=PercentOfIntl), vjust=-0.4) +
ylab("Percent of International Students") +
theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### World map
```{r world map}
# Load the ggmap package
library(ggmap)
# Load in the international student data
intlall = read.csv("intlall.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# Lets look at the first few rows
head(intlall)
# Those NAs are really 0s, and we can replace them easily
intlall[is.na(intlall)] = 0
# Now lets look again
head(intlall) 
# Load the world map
world_map = map_data("world")
str(world_map)
# Lets merge intlall into world_map using the merge command
world_map = merge(world_map, intlall, by.x ="region", by.y = "Citizenship")
str(world_map)
# Plot the map
ggplot(world_map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill="white", color="black") +
  coord_map("mercator")
# Reorder the data
world_map = world_map[order(world_map$group, world_map$order),]
# Redo the plot
ggplot(world_map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill="white", color="black") +
  coord_map("mercator")
# Lets look for China
table(intlall$Citizenship) 
# Lets "fix" that in the intlall dataset
intlall$Citizenship[intlall$Citizenship=="China (People's Republic Of)"] = "China"
# We'll repeat our merge and order from before
world_map = merge(map_data("world"), intlall, 
                  by.x ="region",
                  by.y = "Citizenship")
world_map = world_map[order(world_map$group, world_map$order),]
ggplot(world_map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Total), color="black") +
  coord_map("mercator")
# We can try other projections - this one is visually interesting
ggplot(world_map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Total), color="black") +
  coord_map("ortho", orientation=c(20, 30, 0))
ggplot(world_map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Total), color="black") +
  coord_map("ortho", orientation=c(-37, 175, 0))
```


### Line Charts
```{r linecharts}
# First, lets make sure we have ggplot2 loaded
library(ggplot2)
# Now lets load our dataframe
households = read.csv("households.csv")
str(households)
# Load reshape2
library(reshape2)
# Lets look at the first two columns of our households dataframe
households[,1:2]
# First few rows of our melted households dataframe
head(melt(households, id="Year"))
households[,1:3]
melt(households, id="Year")[1:10,3]
melt(households, id="Year")[1:10,]
# Plot it
ggplot(melt(households, id="Year"),       
       aes(x=Year, y=value, color=variable)) +
  geom_line(size=2) + geom_point(size=5) +  
  ylab("Percentage of Households")
```
