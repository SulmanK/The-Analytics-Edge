## The Analytical Policeman

### The Analytical Policeman

* The explosion of computerized data affects all parts of society, including law and order

* In the past, human judgement and experience was the only tool in identifying patterns in criminal behavior

* Police forces around the US and the world are augmenting human judgement with analytics - sometimes describes as **"predictive"**

### Example: Los Angeles Police Dept.

"I'm not going to get more money. I'm not going to get more cops. I have to be better at using what I have, and that's what **predictive policing ** is about... If this old street cop can change the way that he thinks about this stuff, then I know that my [officers] can do the same."

### The Role of Analytics

* The analytical tools you have learned in this class can be used to make these "predictive policing" models

* However,$\color{red}{\text{communicating}}$ the results of these models is essential - a $\color{blue}{\text{linear regression}}$ output while table will not be of use to a $\color{red}{\text{policewoman on patrol}}$

* Visualization bridges the gap between $\color{blue}{\text{the data and mathematics}}$ and the $\color{red}{\text{end user}}$

### Understanding the Past

* Before we even consider a predictive model, we should try to understand the historical data

* Many cities in the US and around the world would provide logs of reported crimes, usually including the time, locations, and nature of the event

* We will use data from Chicago about motor vehicle thefts

### Crime Over Time

* Suppose we wanted to communicate crime patterns over the course of an average week

* We would display daily averages using a line graph, but this does not seem like it would be too useful

<center>

![](ap1.png)

</center>

* We can replace our **x-axis** with the **hour of the day**, and have different **line for every day of the week**, but this would be a jumbled mess with **7 lines**!

* We could use no visualization at all, and instead present the information in a table

<center>

![](ap2.png)

</center>

* This is valid but how can we make the table more interesting

### Heatmaps

* **Heatmaps** are a way of visualizing data using three attributes. The **x-axis** and **y-axis** are typically displayed horizontally and vertically. The **third attribute** is represented by shades of color.

<center>

![](ap3.png)

</center>


* For example, a **low** number, might be $\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$, and a **high** number might be $\color{red}{\text{red}}$


* We can pick **different color schemes** based on the **type of data** to convey different messages

* The x-axis and y-axis don't need to be continuous - they can be **categorical**

* We could even combine a heatmap with a **geographical map**

### A Chicao Crime Heatmap

* We will use Chicago motor vehicle theft data to explore patterns of crime
    + Over days of the week
    + Over hours of the day

* We're interested in the total number of car thefts that occur in any particular hour of a day of the week: over the whole data set.

### Eye on Crime

* Criminal activity-related data often has both components of time and location

* Sometimes all that is required is a line chart, but heatmaps can visualize data that would be too big for a table

* Plotting data on maps is much more effective than a table for location based data, and is eye-catching

### Predicting Policing

* Many police forces are exploiting their databases to focus finite resources on problem areas

* Not only do analytics help improve policework, the outputs are also good communication tools to decision makers in government and to the wider public

* The application of analytics to data like this is new and growing, with companies like PredPol and Palantir leading the effort.

## The Analytical Policeman in R




#### A Basic Line Plot
```{r basiclineplot}
# Load our data:
mvt = read.csv("mvt.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# Output structure
str(mvt)
# Convert the Date variable to a format that R will recognize:
mvt$Date = strptime(mvt$Date, format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
# Extract the hour and the day of the week:
mvt$Weekday = weekdays(mvt$Date)
mvt$Hour = mvt$Date$hour
# Let's take a look at the structure of our data again:
str(mvt)
# Create a simple line plot - need the total number of crimes on each day of the week. We can get this information by creating a table:
z = table(mvt$Weekday)
kable(z)
# Save this table as a data frame:
WeekdayCounts = as.data.frame(table(mvt$Weekday))
str(WeekdayCounts) 
# Load the ggplot2 library:
library(ggplot2)
# Create our plot
ggplot(WeekdayCounts, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=1))  
# Make the "Var1" variable an ORDERED factor variable
WeekdayCounts$Var1 = factor(WeekdayCounts$Var1, ordered=TRUE, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday","Saturday"))
# Try again:
ggplot(WeekdayCounts, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=1))
# Change our x and y labels:
ggplot(WeekdayCounts, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=1)) + xlab("Day of the Week") + ylab("Total Motor Vehicle Thefts")
```


### Adding the Hour of the Day
```{r addinghouroftheday}
# Create a counts table for the weekday and hour:
z = table(mvt$Weekday, mvt$Hour)
kable(z)
# Save this to a data frame:
DayHourCounts = as.data.frame(table(mvt$Weekday, mvt$Hour))
# Output structure
str(DayHourCounts)
# Convert the second variable, Var2, to numbers and call it Hour:
DayHourCounts$Hour = as.numeric(as.character(DayHourCounts$Var2))
# Create out plot:
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x=Hour, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=Var1))
# Change the colors
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x=Hour, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=Var1, color=Var1), size=2)
# Separate the weekends from the weekdays:
DayHourCounts$Type = ifelse((DayHourCounts$Var1 == "Sunday") | (DayHourCounts$Var1 == "Saturday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
# Redo our plot, this time coloring by Type:
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x=Hour, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=Var1, color=Type), size=2) 
# Make the lines a little transparent:
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x=Hour, y=Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group=Var1, color=Type), size=2, alpha=0.5) 
# Fix the order of the days:
DayHourCounts$Var1 = factor(DayHourCounts$Var1, ordered=TRUE, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
# Make a heatmap:
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x = Hour, y = Var1)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq))
# Change the label on the legend, and get rid of the y-label:
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x = Hour, y = Var1)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq)) + scale_fill_gradient(name="Total MV Thefts") + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
# Change the color scheme
ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x = Hour, y = Var1)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq)) + scale_fill_gradient(name="Total MV Thefts", low="white", high="red") + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

### VIDEO 5 - Maps
```{r Maps}
# Install and load two new packages:
library(maps)
library(devtools)  
library(ggmap)
register_google(key = "AIzaSyBlCZXGDK9dN3Vf_N1qdI6mPfFFCA34ubs")
# Load a map of Chicago into R:
chicago = get_map(location = "chicago", zoom = 11)
# Look at the map
ggmap(chicago)
# Plot the first 100 motor vehicle thefts:
ggmap(chicago) + geom_point(data = mvt[1:100,], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude))
# Round our latitude and longitude to 2 digits of accuracy, and create a crime counts data frame for each area:
LatLonCounts = as.data.frame(table(round(mvt$Longitude,2), round(mvt$Latitude,2)))
# Subset for Freq > 0
LatLonCounts2 = subset(LatLonCounts, Freq > 0)
#Output structure
str(LatLonCounts)
str(LatLonCounts2)
# Convert our Longitude and Latitude variable to numbers:
LatLonCounts$Long = as.numeric(as.character(LatLonCounts$Var1))
LatLonCounts$Lat = as.numeric(as.character(LatLonCounts$Var2))
LatLonCounts2$Long = as.numeric(as.character(LatLonCounts2$Var1))
LatLonCounts2$Lat = as.numeric(as.character(LatLonCounts2$Var2))
# Plot these points on our map:
ggmap(chicago) + geom_point(data = LatLonCounts, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, color = Freq, size=Freq))
# Change the color scheme:
ggmap(chicago) + geom_point(data = LatLonCounts, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, color = Freq, size=Freq)) + scale_colour_gradient(low="yellow", high="red")
# We can also use the geom_tile geometry
ggmap(chicago) + geom_tile(data = LatLonCounts, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, alpha = Freq), fill="red")
#freq > 0
ggmap(chicago) + geom_tile(data=LatLonCounts2, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, alpha=Freq), fill="red")
```


### Geographical Map on US
```{r geomapus}
# Load our data:
murders = read.csv("murders.csv")
# Output structure
str(murders)
# Load the map of the US
statesMap = map_data("state")
# Output structure
str(statesMap)
# Plot the map:
ggplot(statesMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") 
# Create a new variable called region with the lowercase names to match the statesMap:
murders$region = tolower(murders$State)
# Join the statesMap data and the murders data into one dataframe:
murderMap = merge(statesMap, murders, by="region")
str(murderMap)
# Plot the number of murder on our map of the United States:
ggplot(murderMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Murders)) + geom_polygon(color = "black") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "red", guide = "legend")
# Plot a map of the population:
ggplot(murderMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Population)) + geom_polygon(color = "black") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "red", guide = "legend")
# Create a new variable that is the number of murders per 100,000 population:
murderMap$MurderRate = murderMap$Murders / murderMap$Population * 100000
# Redo our plot with murder rate:
ggplot(murderMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = MurderRate)) + geom_polygon(color = "black") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "red", guide = "legend")
# Redo the plot, removing any states with murder rates above 10:
ggplot(murderMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = MurderRate)) + geom_polygon(color = "black") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "red", guide = "legend", limits = c(0,10))
```
