## Moneyball

### The Story

* **Moneyball** tells the story of the Oakland A's in 2002
    + One of the poorest teams in baseball
    + But they were improving every year

### The Problem

* Rich teams can afford the all-star players

* How do the poor teams compete?

<center>

![](poor.png)

### A Different Approach

* The A's started using a different method to select players

* The traditional way was through scouting
    + Scouts would go watch high school and college players
    + Report back about their skills
    + A lot of talk about speed and athletic build

* The A's selected players based on their statistics, not on their looks


    
### The Goal of a Basketball Team

### Making it to the Playoffs

<center>

</center>
* The A's calculated that they needed to score 155 more runs than they allowed during the regular season to expect to win 95 games

* Now, let's verify this statement with Linear Regression

<center>

### Scoring Runs

* How does a team score more runs?

* The A's discovered that two baseball statistics were significantly more important than anything else

    + On-Base Percentage (OBP)
        - Percentage of time a player gets on base (including walks)
    + Slugging Percentage (SLG)
        - How far a player gets around bases on his turn (measures power)

* Most teams focused on Batting Average (BA)

* The A's claimed that
    + OBP was the most important
    + SLG was important
    + BA was overvalued

### Runs Allowed

* Use pitching statistics to predict runs allowed
    + Opponents On-Base Percentage (OOBP)
    + Opponents Slugging Percentage (OSLG)
    
* We get the following linear regression model

$$RunsAllowed = -837.38 + 2913.60(OOBP) + 1514.29(OSLG)$$

### Predicting Runs and Wins

* Can we predict how many games the 2002 Oakland A's will win using our models

* The models for runs use team statistics

* We need to estimate the new team statistics using past player performances
    + Assumes past performances correlates with future performance
    + Assume few injuries

* We can estimate the team statistics for 2002 by using the 2001 player statistics

### Predicting Runs Scored

* Using the 2001 regular season statistics for these players
    + Team OBP is 0.339
    + Team SLG is 0.430

* Our regression equation was

$$RunsScored = -804.63 + 2737.77(OBP) + 1584.91(SLG)$$


* Our 2002 prediction for the A's is


$$RunsScored = -804.63 + 2737.77(0.339) + 1584.91(0.430) = 805$$

### Predicting Runs Allowed


* Using the 2001 regular season statistics for these players
    + Team OOBP is 0.307
    + Team OSLG is 0.373

* Our regression equation was

$$RunsAllowed = -837.38 + 2913.60(OOBP) + 1514.29(OSLG)$$


* Our 2002 prediction for the A's is


$$RunsAllowed = -837.38 + 2913.60(0.307) + 1514.29 (0.373) = 622$$

### Predicting Wins

* Regression equation to predict wins

$$Wins = 80.8814 + 0.1058(RS - RA)$$

$$Wins = 80.8814 + 0.1058(805 - 622) = 100$$

### Results

### The Analytics Edge

* Models allow managers to more accurately value players and minimize risk

* Relatively simple models can be useful


## Moneyball in R

### Linear Regression



#### Read in data
```{r loadinb}
baseball = read.csv("baseball.csv")
str(baseball)
```

#### Subset to only include moneyball years
```{r subsetmoney}
moneyball = subset(baseball, Year < 2002)
str(moneyball)
```

#### Compute Run Difference
```{r computerundiff}
moneyball$RD = moneyball$RS - moneyball$RA
str(moneyball)
```

#### Scatterplot to check for linear relationship
```{r scatterplotlin}
plot(moneyball$RD, moneyball$W)
```

#### Regression model to predict wins
```{r regressionmodpred}
WinsReg = lm(W ~ RD, data=moneyball)
summary(WinsReg)
```

#### Regression model to predict runs scored
```{r regressionmodelscore}
RunsReg = lm(RS ~ OBP + SLG + BA, data=moneyball)
summary(RunsReg)

```
