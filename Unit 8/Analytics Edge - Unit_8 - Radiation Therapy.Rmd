## Radiation Therapy

### Cancer
* Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated **570,000 deaths** in 2013

* Over **1.6 million new cases** of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2013

* In the world, cancer is also a leading cause of death - **8.2 million deaths** in 2012

### Radiation Therapy

* Cancer can be treated using radiation therapy (RT)

* In RT, beams of high energy photons are fired into the patient that are able to kill cancerous cells

* In the United States, about **half of all cancer patients** undergo some form of radiation therapy

### History of Radiation Therapy

* X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895 (awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901)
    + Shortly after, x-rays started being used to treat skin cancers

* Radium discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 (Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911)
    + Begun to used to treat cancer, as well as other diseases
    
* First radiation delivery machines (linear accelerators) developed in 1940

* Computed tomography (CT) invented in 1971

* **Invention of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in early 1980s**

### IMRT
* To reach the tumor, radiation passes through healthy issue, and damages both healthy and cancerous tissue

* Damage to healthy tissue can lead to undesirable side effects that reduce post-treatment quality of life

* We want the dose to "fit" the tumor as closely as possible, to reduce the dose to healthy tissues

* In IMRT, the intensity profile of each beam is non-uniform 

* By using non-uniform intensity profiles, the three-dimensional shape of the dose can better fit the tumor

### Using IMRT

### Designing an IMRT Treatment

* Fundamental problem:
    + How should the beamlet intensities be selected to deliver a therapeutic dose to the tumor *and* to minimize damage to healthy tissue
    
### The Data

* Treatment planning starts from a CT scan
    + A radiation oncologist contours (draws outlines) around the tumor and various critical structures
    + Each structure is discretized into voxels (volume elements) - typically 4 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm

</center>


* From CT scan, can compute how much dose each beamlet delivers to every voxel

### Small Example - 9 Voxels, 6 Beamlets

<center>

![](se1.png)

</center>

* Minimize total dose to healthy tissue (spinal + other)

* Constraints: tumor voxels at least 7Gy (Gray) , spinal cord voxel at most 5Gy

#### The Model

</center>



### A Head and Neck Example

* We will test out this approach on a head-and-neck case
      + Total of 132,878 voxels
      + One target volume (9,777 voxels)
      + Five critical structures: spinal cord, brain, brain stem, parotid glands, mandible (jaw)
      + 5 beams; each beam ~60 beamlets (1cm x 1cm) for a total of 328 beamlets
      
#### Treatment Plan Criteria

* Dose to whole tumor between 70Gy and 77Gy

* Maximum spinal cord at most 45Gy
    + Significant damage to any voxel will result in loss of function

* Maximum brain stem dose at 54Gy

* Maximum mandible dose at most 70Gy

* Mean parotid gland dose at most 26Gy
    + Parotid gland is a parallel structure: significant damage to any voxel does not jeopardize function of entire organ

#### Solution

#### Exploring Different Solutions

* Mean mandible dose was 11.3Gy - how can we reduce this?

* one approach: modify objective function
    + Current objective is the sum of the total dose
    
    $$T_B + T_{BS} + T_{SC} + T_{PG} + T_{M}$$
    + Change objective to
    
    $$T_B + T_{BS} + T_{SC} + T_{PG} + 10T_{M}$$
    + Set mandible weight from 1 (current solution) to 10
    
#### New Solution

#### Sensitivity
* Another way to explore tradeoffs is to modify constraints
    + For example: by relaxing the mandible maximum dose constraint, we may improve our total healthy tissue dose
    + How much does the objective change for different constraints?
    
#### Shadow Prices

<center>

![](news2.png)

</center>

* Parotid gland and brain stem have shadow prices of zero
      + Modifying these constraints is not beneficial

* Mandible has highest shadow price
      + If a slight increase in mandible dose is acceptable, total healthy tissue dose can be significantly reduced
  
### IMRT Optimization in Practice

* Radiation machines are connected to treatment planning software that implements and solves optimization models (linear and other types)
    + Pinnacle by Philips
    + RayStation by RaySearch Labs
    + Eclipse by Varian
    
### Extensions
* Selection of beam angles
    + Beam angles can be selected jointly with intensity profiles using **integer optimization** 

* Uncertainty
    + Often quality of IMRT treatments is degraded due to uncertain organ motion (e.g., in lung cancer, patient breathing)
    + Can manage uncertainty using a method known as **robust optimization**

### Efficiency
* Manually designing an IMRT treatment is inefficient and impractical

* Linear optimization provides an *efficient* and *systematic way of designing an IMRT treatment*
    + Clinical criteria can be modeled using constraints
    + By changing the model, treatment planner can explore tradeoffs
    
### Clinical Benefits
* Ultimately, IMRT Benefits the patient
    + In head and neck cancers, saliva glands were rarely spared prior to IMRT; optimized IMRT treatments spare saliva glands
    + In prostate cancer, optimized IMRT treatments reduce toxicities and allow for higher tumor doses to be delivered safely
    + In lung cancer, optimized IMRT reduces risk of radiation-induced pneumonia
