## Optimizing Online Advertising

### Google Inc.

* Provides products and services related to the Internet
    + Mission: "... to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."

* Most widely known for its search engine
    + User enters a query, Google returns links to websites that best fit query

### History of Google
* 1996 - Sergei Brin and Larry Page, graduate students at Stanford, working on a research project
    + How to measure importance of any webpage using links on the internet

* 1998 - Incorporated Google as a company and received first funding; database of 60 million webpages

* 2005 - Initial Public Offering

* 2007 - Google acquires YouTube and other companies

* 2013 - **More than 1 billion unique monthly visitors**

### Google's Business Model
* Google search engine is free to use, so how does Google make money?

* Answer: **online advertising**

### Google Advertising - AdWords
* Why do companies advertise on Google?
    + Google receives heavy traffic
    + Search pages are formatted in a very clean way
    + Companies can choose which type of queries their adds will be displayed for; better targeting

* 97% of Google's revenues come from AdWords

### How does Advertising on Google work?

* Advertisers place bids for different queries in an auction

* Based on bids and *quality save* (fit of advertiser and ad to the queries), Google decides price-per-click of each advertisers and each query

* Google then decides how often to display each ad for each query

### Price-per-click (PPC)
* For each query, Google decides each advertiser's **price-per-click (PPC)**
    + How much advertiser pays Google when user clicks ad for that query

* Each advertiser also species a **budget**
    + Each time user clicks on advertiser's ad, budget is depleted by PPC amount

### Example of price-per-click

### Click-through Rate (CTR)

* Advertiser only pays Google if the user *clicks* on the ad

* The probability that a user clicks on an advertiser's ad is the **click-through rate (CTR)**
    + Can also think of as "clicks per user"

### Example of click-through rate

### Average Price Per Display

* Average amount that an advertiser pays each time its ad is shown is **PPC x CTR**

### Query estimates
* Google does not control how many times a query will be requested - driven by users!

* For each query, Google has estimate of number of times query will be requested over a given day

### Google's problem
* **How many times to display each ad for each query to maximize revenue**

* Objective
    + Maximize revenue
* Decision
    + For each advertiser and query, number of times ad will be displayed for that query
* Constraints
    + Average amount paid by each advertiser cannot exceed budget
    + Total ads for given query cannot exceed estimated number of requests for that query

#### Modeling the problem

#### Slates/positions
* Search result page has space for more than one ad

* **Slate**: combination of ads

* Many possible slates: which ones to display?

#### Personalization
* In addition to the query, Google can use other information to decide which ad to display:
    + IP address/geographic location
    + Previous Google searches/browser activity on Google

* How do we account for this?

### AdWords at Google's scale?
* In reality, problem is much larger
    + Hundreds to thousands of bidders, over $40 billion
    + Gains from optimization at this scale become enormous
