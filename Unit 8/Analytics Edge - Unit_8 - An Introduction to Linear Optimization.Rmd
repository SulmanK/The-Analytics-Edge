## REVENUE MANAGEMENT

### Airline Regulation (1938-1978) 

* The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) set fares, routes, and schedules for all interstate air transport

* Most major airlines favored this system due to guaranteed profits

* Led to inefficiency and higher costs
    + Applications for new routes and fares often delayed or dismissed
    
### Airline Deregulation (1978)

* The administration of President Jimmy Carter passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978

* The Act encouraged
    + **More competition**: 52 new airlines between 1980 and 2000
    + **New air routes**: saved passengers an estimated $10.3 billion each year in travel time
    + **Lower fares**: ticket prices are 40% lower today than they were in 1978

* This led to **more passengers**
    + The number of air passengers increased from 207.5 million in 197.4 to 721.1 million in 2010
    
### A competetitive Edge
* More competition led to heavy losses by air carriers
    + Need to lower fares while meeting operating costs

* 9 major carriers and more than 100 smaller airlines went bankrupt between 1978 and 2002

* How did airlines compete?

### Discount Fares

* On January 17, 1985 American Airlines (AA) launched its Ultimate Super Saver fares to compete with PeopleExpress

* Need to fill at least a minimum number of seats without selling every seat at discount prices
    + Sell enough seats to cover fixed operating costs
    + Sell remaining seats at higher rates to maximize revenues/profits
    
### How Many Seats to Sell on Discount
* Passengers have different valuations
    + Business people value flexibility (last-minute/refundable)
    + People seeking getaways value good deals (early birds)

* Sell too many discounted seats
    + Not enough seats for high-paying passengers

* Sell too few discounted seats
    + Empty seats at takeoff implying lost revenue

* How should AA allocates its seat among customers to maximize its revenue

#### Demand Forecasting

* Demand for different prices can be forecasted using analytics tools, looking at historical data and incorporating models of human behavior
      + Time series methods
      + Linear regression

* Forecasts could be erroneous
      + Need to assess sensitivity to forecast errors

* We'll assume that demand has been forecasted

#### Myopic Solution

<center>

![](t1.png)

</center>

* How many discount seats to sell to maximize revenue

* This seems simple, but what if we had 100 different flights?

#### Single Route Example

<center>

![](t2.png)

</center>

* Problem: Find the optimal number of discounted seats and regular seats to sell to maximize revenue

#### Step 1: Decisions

<center>

![](t2.png)

</center>

* What are our decisions?
    + Number of regular seats to sell - R
    + Number of discount seats to sell - D

#### Step 2: Objective

<center>

![](t2.png)

</center>

* What is our objective?
    + Maximizing total airline revenue
    + Revenue from each type of seat is equal to the number of that type of seat sold times the seat price

$$max = 617R + 238D$$

#### Step 3: Constraints

<center>

![](t2.png)

</center>

* AA cannot sell more seats than the capacity
    + Total number of seats sold cannot exceed capacity


$$R + D \leq 166$$
* AA cannot sell more seats than the demand
    + Regular seats sold cannot exceed 100 
    
$$R \leq 100$$
    + Discount seats sold cannot exceed 150

$$D \leq 150$$


#### Step 4 : Non-Negativity

<center>

![](t2.png)

</center>

* AA cannot sell a negative number of seats

    $$R \geq 0 ,  D \geq 0$$

#### Problem Formulation

* Maximize
    + Total airline revenue
    
    $$617R + 238D$$

* Subject to
    + Seats sold cannot exceed capacity
    
    $$R + D \leq 166$$
    + Seats sold cannot exceed demand
    
    $$R \leq 100, D \leq 150$$
    + Seats sold cannot be negative
    
    $$R \geq 0, D \geq 0$$

#### Marketing Decisions

* Management is trying to figure out whether it would be beneficial to invest in marketing its fares

* AA forecasts that its marketing effort is likely to attract one more unit of demand per $200 spent

### Connecting Flights

#### Step 1: Decisions

<center>

![](cf1.png)

</center>

* Number of regular seats to sell

$$R_{JFK-LAX} , R_{JFK-DFW} , R_{DFW-LAX}$$
* Number of discount seats to sell

$$D_{JFK-LAX} , D_{JFK-DFW} , D_{DFW-LAX}$$

#### Step 2: Objective
<center>

![](cf1.png)

</center>

* Maximize total revenue

$$428R_{JFK-LAX} + 190D_{JFK-LAX} + 642R_{JFK-DFW} + 224D_{JFK-DFW} + 512R_{DFW-LAX} + 190D_{DFW-LAX}$$

#### Step 3: Constraints

<center>

![](cf1.png)

</center>

* AA cannot sell more seats than the aircraft capacity
    + First leg - JFK-DFW
    
    $$R_{JFK-LAX} + D_{JFK-LAX} + R_{JFK-DFW} + D_{JFK-DFW} \leq 166$$
    + Second leg - DFW-LAX
    
    $$R_{JFK-LAX} + D_{JFK-LAX} + R_{DFW-LAX} + D_{DFW-LAX} \leq 166$$
* AA cannot sell more seats than the demand

$$R_{JFK-LAX} \leq 80 , D_{JFK-LAX} \leq 120$$
$$R_{JFK-DFW} \leq 75 , D_{JFK-DFW} \leq 100$$
$$R_{DFW-LAX} \leq 60 , D_{DFW-LAX} \leq 110$$

#### Step 4: Non-Negativity
<center>

![](cf1.png)

</center>

* AA cannot sell a negative number of seats

$$R_{JFK-LAX} \geq 0 , D_{JFK-LAX} \geq 0$$
$$R_{JFK-DFW} \geq 0 , D_{JFK-DFW} \geq 0$$
$$R_{DFW-LAX} \geq 0 , D_{DFW-LAX} \geq 0$$

### The Competitive Strategy of AA

* Selling the right seats to the right customers at the right prices

"**Revenue management** is the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered the era of airline deregulation." 
- Robert Crandall, former CEO of AA (~1985)


"We estimate that revenue management has generated **$1.4 billion in incremental revenue** in the last three years." - Robert Crandall, former CEO of AA (~1985)

### The Edge of Revenue Management

* Sabre Holdings
    + Built revenue management system for AA
    + As of November 2012, ranked 133 among America's largest private companies with $3.15 billion in sales
    + 400 airlines, 90,000 hotels, 30 car-rental companies

* Today, companies prosper from revenue management
    + Delta airlines increased annual revenue by $300 million
    + Marriott hotels increased annual revenue by $100 million
